#     Project-1 Weather App
#   Description

This project aims to develop a weather application that provides users with real-time weather information based on their current location or searched locations. The app will display essential weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant details. It will also feature visual representations of weather conditions, allowing users to quickly grasp the current weather situation. Additionally, the app will support various features like hourly forecasts, location search functionality, saving and managing multiple locations, integration with Google Maps, weather alerts/notifications, and a 5-day forecast. As a stretch goal, the app may also include additional weather-related information like UV index, air quality index, pollen count, or sunrise/sunset times.
