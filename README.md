# Holiday Explorer

# Description:
Holiday Explorer is a web application that helps users discover and explore various holiday destinations around the world. It provides users with information about popular tourist spots, attractions, activities, and local recommendations for different destinations. Users can search for specific locations or browse through curated lists of destinations based on different themes, such as beach getaways, historical sites, or adventure trips. The application utilizes HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (including libraries like jQuery), and server-side APIs such as the Google Maps API and OpenWeatherMap API.

The Weather App is another project that aims to provide users with real-time weather information. It displays essential weather data like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant details. The app features visual representations of weather conditions, hourly forecasts, location search functionality, the ability to save and manage multiple locations, integration with Google Maps, weather alerts/notifications, and a 5-day forecast. As a stretch goal, the app may also include additional weather-related information like UV index, air quality index, pollen count, or sunrise/sunset times.
